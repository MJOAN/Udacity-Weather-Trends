I. Outline: 
    1. What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)

        The .csv files were retrieved from the SQL user interface Udacity provides when querying all rows for the `global_data` table while joining `city_list` where `city` = `Los Angeles` to the `city_data` table to retrieve only this city's average temperatues. 
        
        Starting with a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook I imported pandas, matplotlib and IPuthon display features. Using the Pandas `read_csv` method I saved each `csv` file to a Pandas DataFrame variable name specific to the data. From there I had to drop the last 2 rows and first 99 rows from `global_data` because the length rows differed from `city_data`. Using the Pandas `shape` method quickly displays number of rows, and number of columns.

        From there I created separate DataFrames for the `city_year`, `city_temp`, `global_year`, and `global_temp` so there was data to plot against using an x and y axis. 


    2. How did you calculate the moving average?

        Using `matplotlib` for the chart visual I chose to use their formular for `moving average` which was: `.rolling(window=30).mean()` where `window` equals the `moving average` number of days. 

    3. What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?

        The key considerations for visualizing trends was thinking about how many `moving averages` did I need to display. In this case, it was two, the global and city data. The Python library `matplotlib` has a line chart option which provides exactly what we need here to show the average changing temperatures.


II. At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends:

    1. Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? 
    Has the difference been consistent over time?
    2. How do the changes in your cityâ€™s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
    3. What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? 
    4. Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
