I. Outline: 
    1. What tools did you use for each step? (Python, SQL, Excel, etc)

        The .csv files were retrieved from the SQL user interface Udacity provides when querying all rows for the `global_data` table while joining `city_list` where `city` = `Los Angeles` to the `city_data` table to retrieve only this city's average temperatues. 
        
        Starting with a Python 3 Jupyter Notebook I imported pandas, matplotlib and IPuthon display features. Using the Pandas `read_csv` method I saved each `csv` file to a Pandas DataFrame variable name specific to the data. From there I had to drop the last 2 rows and first 99 rows from `global_data` because the length rows differed from `city_data`. Using the Pandas `shape` method quickly displays number of rows, and number of columns. From there I created separate DataFrames for the `city_year`, `city_temp`, `global_year`, and `global_temp` so there was data to plot for the x and y axis. 

    2. How did you calculate the moving average?

        Using `matplotlib` for the chart visual I chose to use their formular for `moving average` which was: `.rolling(window=30).mean()` where `window` equals the `moving average` number of days. 

    3. What were your key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?

        When searching for `trends` in matplotlib I found a Stack Overflow post that showed how to create a function to calculate the slope of a given set of values. In this case, I called the function twice to create two slopes, one for local and one for global. Each displayed a decimal value. When understanding trend lines, I learned that if the result was `0` then the trend is constant while anything below 0 was decreasing and above 0 was increasing. In both cases the trend is increasing.

II. At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends:

    1. Is your city hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
        - Los Angeles temperatures were hotter on average compared to global average and this has been consistent over the entire dataset.

    2. How do the changes in your cityâ€™s temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average? 
        - The `mean()` of both Pandas Series for local and global temperatures was `8` so the difference in Celsius temperature averaged about an `8` degree difference between them. While the variance taken on the average temperatures within each dataset varied `32%` for local data and `34%` for global data. So changes within each dataset was very similar and mean shows less than 10 degree difference between average temperatures.
    
    3. What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? 
        - Looking at the results from deriving a slope of both datasets, city trend was `0.005113830043010149` while global trend was `0.004733619080561259` which shows Los Angeles, CA is trending a bit higher than global temperatures. 
    
    4. Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
        - This has been consistent over the few hundred years from viewing the steadily increasing line in the line chart.
